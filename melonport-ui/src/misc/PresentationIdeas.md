# Intro

Tell what problem we wanted to solve:

## Ranking
**Why is THIS fund number one?**
Show old ranking
The ranking doesn't say much --> visualize why!

## Strategy
**What Fund suits me well?**
Show fund overview --> not really helping when you have hundreds of funds
MelonSpider --> provide input what I care about and compare with funds ("Fund Matchmaking")

## Comparison
**TODO what question we answer???**
Compare funds on share price / performance


# Results

## Melon Spider
0 funds marked: show own spider
1 fund marked: show own spider + fund1 spider
